# Go Lift TV - YOURLS

The changes in this fork allow Nginx proxy auth. I use this behind
[Organizr](https://github.com/causefx/Organizr) with Nginx proxy auth.
The changes specifically allow me (or you) to expose the `/admin` interface
to (authorized) users on one domain while creating short links on another.
My admin interface is on `golift.tv`, but the short links use `l.golift.tv`.
You may choose any domains you wish. The app uses the `/admin`, `/js`, `/css`
and `/images` paths on the _admin_ domain, so you will need to account for that.
I provided a sample solution in the nginx config below.

**If you use this code you must protect your `/admin` path!**

This is the running nginx config. YOURLS is installed at `/config/www/YOURLS/`.
```shell
# Server for public domain.
server {
  server_name        l.*;
  listen             443 ssl http2;
  include            /config/nginx/ssl.conf;
  root               /config/www/YOURLS;
  index              index.php index.html index.htm;
  location /admin {
    return 403;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
    fastcgi_pass            127.0.0.1:9000;
    fastcgi_index           index.php;
    include                 /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
  }

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /yourls-loader.php$is_args$args;
  }
}

# YOURLS admin interface on different (or same) domain.
# Add this inside your existing server block.
# Mine lives in the letsencrypt Docker container nginx config file.ÃŸ
# Uses Organizr auth to authorize users.
location /admin {
  auth_request.    /auth-4;
  auth_request_set $user $upstream_http_x_organizr_user;
  add_header       X-WEBAUTH-USER $user;
  root             /config/www/YOURLS;
  index            index.php index.html index.htm;
  location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
    fastcgi_pass            127.0.0.1:9000;
    fastcgi_index           index.php;
    include                 /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
  }

  location /admin {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /yourls-loader.php$is_args$args;
  }
}

# These blocks allow serving assets for /images, /js and /css from more than 1 location.
# These paths are not using auth, but could if you want more server load.
location /images {
  root      /config/www/;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /YOURLS$uri /YOURLS$uri/ @organizr;
}
location /css {
  root      /config/www/;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /YOURLS$uri /YOURLS$uri/ @organizr;
}
location /js {
  root      /config/www/;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /YOURLS$uri /YOURLS$uri/ @organizr;
}
